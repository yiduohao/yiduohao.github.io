Hi! I am a first-year CIS Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I finished my undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). I was a research intern at EPFL, advised by [Prof. Haitham Hassanieh](https://people.epfl.ch/haitham.alhassanieh/?lang=en) and [Prof. Saurabh Gupta](https://saurabhg.web.illinois.edu/). Before that, I was fortunate to intern at the Visual Computing Group in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) , collaborating with [Dr. Yuhui Yuan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuyua/) and [Dr. Han Hu](https://ancientmooner.github.io/). 

My research area lies broadly in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, I am interested in 3D Computer Vision, Multimodal Multi-Sensor Learning and Generative Models. I am also excited about their applications in Robotics and Autonomous Driving.
