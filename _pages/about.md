Hi! I am a final-year undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge, majoring in Information and Computer Engineering, and supervised by [Prof. Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). 

Previously, I was a research intern at EPFL under [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch/) program, advised by [Prof. Haitham Hassanieh](https://people.epfl.ch/haitham.alhassanieh/?lang=en) and [Prof. Saurabh Gupta](https://saurabhg.web.illinois.edu/). Before that, I was fortunate to intern at the Visual Computing Group in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) , collaborating with [Dr. Yuhui Yuan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuyua/) and [Dr. Han Hu](https://ancientmooner.github.io/). 

**Research Interests**
My research area lies at the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Wireless Sensing. Specifically, I am interested in Self-Supervised Learning and Generative AI for multiple modalities, including vision, wireless, sound, etc. 

**I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position in 2024 Fall.**
