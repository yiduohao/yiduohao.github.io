Hi! I am a first-year CIS Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Previously, I finished my undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/) in the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/). I was fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Haitham Hassanieh](https://people.epfl.ch/haitham.alhassanieh/?lang=en) at EPFL, [Prof. Saurabh Gupta](https://saurabhg.web.illinois.edu/) at UIUC, [Dr. Yuhui Yuan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuyua/) and [Dr. Han Hu](https://ancientmooner.github.io/) at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). 

My research area lies broadly in Computer Vision and Multimodal Learning. Specifically, I am interested in 3D Vision, Video-Audio Learning, Sensor Fusion, and Generative Models. I am also excited about their applications to Robotics, and Autonomous Driving.
