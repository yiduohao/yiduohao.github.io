Hi! I am a final-year undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge, majoring in Information and Computer Engineering. I am working at the [Cambridge Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). 

Previously, I was a research intern at EPFL under the [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch/) program, advised by [Prof. Haitham Hassanieh (EPFL)](https://people.epfl.ch/haitham.alhassanieh/?lang=en) and [Prof. Saurabh Gupta (UIUC)](https://saurabhg.web.illinois.edu/). Before that, I was fortunate to intern at the Visual Computing Group in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) , collaborating with [Dr. Yuhui Yuan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuyua/) and [Dr. Han Hu](https://ancientmooner.github.io/). 

**Research Interests** My research area lies broadly in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Robotics. Specifically, I am interested in Generative Models and Multimodality for 2D/3D vision, as well as language, wireless, and acoustics. I am also excited about their applications in robotics and autonomous driving. 

**I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position in 2024 Fall.**
