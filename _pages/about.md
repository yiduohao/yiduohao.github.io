Hi! I am a second-year CIS Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Previously, I finished my undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, where I worked in the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). I was fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Haitham Hassanieh](https://people.epfl.ch/haitham.alhassanieh/?lang=en) at EPFL, [Prof. Saurabh Gupta](https://saurabhg.web.illinois.edu/) at UIUC, as well as [Dr. Yuhui Yuan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuyua/) and [Dr. Han Hu](https://ancientmooner.github.io/) at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). 

My research focuses on Multimodal Machine Learning, particularly at the intersection of Computer Vision, Audio Processing, and Sensor Fusion. I am also excited about applying these techniques to areas such as Robotics, Autonomous Driving, and AR/VR/XR.
